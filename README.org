* Thoughts on cost
** TODO Money / Currency
- Will ignore currenty thoughts for the moment
- Everything be in pence - avoid floating-point arithmetic problems for now... 

** TODO Units - How an amount of goods is represented
*** Physical number - e.g. 2 cans of coke
- Likely to be a whole number
*** Some type of weight - e.g 0.200 kg
- Shown as a decimal in a example, are these required when you can use gramms or mililitres for instance

** Offers - What are these actually?
*** TODO Example 1 Beans 3 for the price of 2
Total/3 but what happens if there are 4 items? Usually this would be a full-price right

*** TODO Example 2 - Coke 2 for Â£1

* TODO Thoughts on basket
