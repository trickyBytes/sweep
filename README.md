Java application to explore a model for calculate the cost or price of items within a basket of goods


### Building / Running the application
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/trickyBytes/sweep.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/trickyBytes/sweep)

This is a Java 8 application, built using Gradle

*Using gradle wrapper on linux*
- To run tests ./gradlew test
- To build ./gradlew build
- To run ./gradlew run

### Thoughts on cost

*TODO Money / Currency*
- Will ignore currenty thoughts for the moment
- Everything be in pence - avoid floating-point arithmetic problems for now... 

*TODO Units - How an amount of goods is represented*
- Physical number - e.g. 2 cans of coke
- Likely to be a whole number

- Some type of weight - e.g 0.200 kg
- Shown as a decimal in a example, are these required when you can use gramms or mililitres for instance

### Offers - What are these actually?

*TODO Example 1 Beans 3 for the price of 2*
Total/3 but what happens if there are 4 items? Usually this would be a full-price right

*TODO Example 2 - Coke 2 for Â£1*

*Should offers be time limited?*

### Thoughts on basket

- Calculation - should be simple - ask each entry
- VAT - changes over time so you'd get VAT rate at given time from somewhere

### Assumptions
- Bulk Price Offers can be applied to multiples of the offer, i.e. if the bulk price is 100 for two items, then if there are 4 items you should get them for 200
- Offers are not time limited for now

### TODO's
- Test combinations of offers
- Look at complexity, can offers and products be simpler, plus do we need a til?
- Rounding what should rounding be?
- Look at JODA money
- Show a nice formatted reciept
- I think offers are basket visitors or strategies so alter the code to match
- Implenent units in products
- Turns out unique ID's for products are called SKUS - maybe call them that and create class for them
